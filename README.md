# bigelow-pwa-text-editor

## Description

This is just another text editor. However, as a Progressive Web Application, it can be run through your browser and accessed by its own desktop icon. It has a light code base and is easy to use. As for my personal motivation for building this app, it helped give me a sense of what PWAs are, their advantages and disadvantages, and how to build them. 

## Installation

The easiest way to use this app is to use the link to the deployed application: https://whispering-mountain-87917.herokuapp.com/. You can create a desktop shortcut by clicking "install!" in the upper lefthand corner.

The app is still run through the browser, but you have the ease of access that would come from having a native app on your device. Alternatively, you can clone the repo to your device and deploy it to Heroku yourself. 

## Usage

Once you have the app running, you'll find the app works much the same as any other text editor, just without many of the fancy bells and whistles.

It is a plain text editor, not unlike Windows Notepad. However, it has the advantage of creating a new line once you are reaching the edge of your window space.

## Tests

Once you have opened the app in your browser for the first time, you should be able to type in the text field and see the text appear on the page. Next, if you click "install!", you should see another window pop up which contains the same app. If you check your desktop, there should be an icon which is labeled "jate text editor".

If you click the icon, it should open the app once again.
